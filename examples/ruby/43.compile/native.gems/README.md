Future posts are planned to go into details like:
* The interface between Ruby and C
* The Development Makefile and a Makefile that also works on Windows
* Running the specs and the performance benchmark
* Enhancements:
- Providing an executable
- A gem that also works on JRuby
- Making the gem ractor friendly
- Patching an existing gem rather than a new module
