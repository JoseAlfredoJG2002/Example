A bit of (personal) history

I learned Ruby, I think, around 2007, and back then, it was a language pushing boundaries for me. Before encountering Ruby, I worked with Java, C/C++, PHP, and Python, and even dig into the strange world of JS (back then when Scriptaculous and Prototype.js were the hot JS libraries and jQuery was appearing).

In the beginning, Ruby looked strange, made people uncomfortable when reading the syntax, and created emotion.

I remember when I read the first time code written in Ruby (1.8.6) was very strange for me: no ;, optional parenthesis, using unless, being able to write if at the end of a statement, the strange lack of for, while , repeat and the continued usage of each this was just the tip of the iceberg along with Rails 1.2 and later on Rails 2.

Ruby looked very alien compared with other typical languages that I was using. For me, it was a language that created its own category, very close to the English language and with pseudocode.
