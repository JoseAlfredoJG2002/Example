# Ruby - String Concatenation

To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

```ruby
# Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
puts c
```

```ruby
# To add a space between them, add a " ":
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
puts c
```
